###### I am glad someone came here. Do you know the nail? On the basketball court, the nail is located at the middle of the free throw line, the key of help defense. But now, Nail is a serious basketball community website, and here is the repository where its resource code is stored. You can visit Nail in the future at the URL <http://freethrowline.center>.

###### I love basketball, but there is no truly pure place where I can talk to people about it (as of 2023/12/29), which is why I started this website. Nail is expected to be a site with 4,000 to 8,000 users, and has a well-developed user management and article classification system. Given that nowadays people tend to just throw out their own point of view without proving it, I hope that the articles inside Nail will be mainly rational, objective and argumentative.

###### This is absolutely a challenge for me.
