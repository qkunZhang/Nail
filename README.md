## Introduction :heart:

###### Glad to have someone here! Do you know the nail? On the basketball court, the nail is located at the middle of the free throw line, the key of help defense. But now, Nail is a serious basketball community website, and here is the repository where its resource code is stored. You can visit Nail **in the future** at the URL <http://freethrowline.center>.

###### I love basketball, but there is no truly pure place where I can talk to people about it (as of 2023/12/29), which is why I started this website. Nail is expected to be a site with less than 10,000 users, and has a well-developed user management and article classification system. Given that nowadays people tend to just throw out their own point of view without proving it, I hope that the articles inside Nail will be mainly rational, objective and argumentative.

###### You must get an unused invitation code, which can be obtained from community members if you want to join our community. Sometimes the official will take the initiative to send an invitation code to your email, provided that you have a certain level of fame and contribution in basketball.
